          <h3>Senior Front-end Developer @ Eneco</h3>
          <h4>July 2019 &mdash; March 20249 · Freelance</h4>
          <p>In my 5 years at Eneco<span className="sidenote-anchor"></span><span
            className="sidenote">My longest project ever</span>, I was entrusted with the
            complex but exciting task of migrating an old platform to a
            new one, which heavily relied on <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Testing
              Library</strong>. <strong>Sitecore</strong> was used as a CMS.</p>
          <p>I played an important role in elevating the team to the next level. I not only successfully transitioned
            the
            platform with minimal disruption but also spent a significant amount of time improving the way of working.
            This involved enhancing efficiency in refinement sessions, streamlining peer review processes and
            documenting
            user scenarios, with a particular emphasis on expectations, to ensure that the platform was user-centric and
            intuitive. Moreover, I played a key role in discussing and implementing API endpoints.</p>
          <p>This experience has sharpened my technical skills and honed my ability to deliver high-quality work under
            tight deadlines.</p>

          <p>After a good previous collaboration<span className="sidenote-anchor"></span><span
            className="sidenote">My second time at Redhotminute</span> with Redhotminute I was asked again to help
            develop
            two
            new
            projects:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Another NGF (Dutch Golf Federation) project. In this case it involved the front-end development for
                NGF's new corporate website. All <strong>React</strong> components were developed
                using <strong>Patternlab</strong> and implemented in a Sitecore environment using Razor. Other
                techniques
                used were <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>Gulp</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>Rebranding of the VanGansewinkel/Renewi website

          <h3>Senior Front-end Developer @ CZ</h3>
          <h4>Aug 2016 &mdash; Apr 2017 · Freelance</h4>
          <p>As part of a scrum team, I was responsible for setting up a <strong>Patternlab</strong>. This
            styleguide served as the front-end basis in the process of redesigning all <em>CZ</em> portals in a Sitecore
            8.2
            environment.</p>
          <p>As front-end developer, not only was I responsible for the actual technical implementation in the front-end
            area, I was also highly involved in coming up with solutions for problems that transcend disciplines, even
            before a single line of code was written.</p>

          <h3>Senior Front-end Developer @ Redhotminute</h3>
          <h4>Feb 2016 &mdash; Jul 2016 · Freelance</h4>
          <p>I helped develop an app with accompanying website for the <em>NGF</em> (Dutch Golf Federation). My
            responsibility was mainly with the front-end for the responsive website. I worked closely with the designer
            and the Sitecore/iOS developers because the main focus of the design was on the app and the website had to
            match that as closely as possible. Long-term project of several months in a SCRUM team. Some of the
            techniques
            used: <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>, <strong>Gulp</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>.

          <h4>Oct 2014 &mdash; Feb 2016 · Freelance</h4>
          <p>I worked on the iOS/Android/Windows app with accompanying website and CMS system. The hybrid app
            (<strong>HTML5</strong>/<strong>CSS</strong>/<strong>JavaScript</strong>) was built on the Cordova
            framework.
            The back-end was built in <strong>PHP</strong> using Twig as the template engine. Besides
            writing <strong>HTML</strong>,
            <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, I was also responsible
            for <strong>UX/UI</strong> related challenges which were numerous in this project.</p>
