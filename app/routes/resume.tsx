        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Front-end Developer @ Eneco</h3>
        <h4>July 2019 &mdash; March 2024 · Freelance</h4>
        <p><span
          className="sidenote">My longest project ever</span>In my 5 years at Eneco, I was entrusted with the
          complex but exciting task of migrating an old platform to a
          new one, which heavily relied on <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Testing
            Library</strong>. <strong>Sitecore</strong> was used as a CMS.</p>
        <p>I played an important role in elevating the team to the next level. I not only successfully transitioned
          the
          platform with minimal disruption but also spent a significant amount of time improving the way of working.
          This involved enhancing efficiency in refinement sessions, streamlining the peer review process and
          writing extensive documentation. Moreover, I played a key role in discussing and implementing data
          endpoints.</p>
        <p>This experience has sharpened my technical skills and honed my ability to deliver high-quality work under
          tight deadlines.</p>

          and Sitecore/iOS developers because it was important for the app and website to be as similar as possible. Some of the
