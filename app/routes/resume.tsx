        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Front-end Developer @ Eneco</h3>
        <h4>July 2019 &mdash; March 2024 · Freelance</h4>
        <p>In my 5 years at Eneco<span className="sidenote-anchor"></span><span
          className="sidenote">My longest project ever</span>, I was entrusted with the
          complex but exciting task of migrating an old platform to a
          new one, which heavily relied on <strong>React</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, <strong>Testing
            Library</strong>. <strong>Sitecore</strong> was used as a CMS.</p>
        <p>I played an important role in elevating the team to the next level. I not only successfully transitioned
          the
          platform with minimal disruption but also spent a significant amount of time improving the way of working.
          This involved enhancing efficiency in refinement sessions, streamlining peer review processes and
          documenting
          user scenarios, with a particular emphasis on expectations, to ensure that the platform was user-centric and
          intuitive. Moreover, I played a key role in discussing and implementing API endpoints.</p>
        <p>This experience has sharpened my technical skills and honed my ability to deliver high-quality work under
          tight deadlines.</p>

        <p>After a good previous collaboration<span className="sidenote-anchor"></span><span
          className="sidenote">My second time at Redhotminute</span> with Redhotminute I was asked again to help
          develop
          two
          new
          projects:</p>
        <ul>

          8.2
          environment.</p>
        <p>As front-end developer, not only was I responsible for the actual technical implementation in the front-end
          area, I was also highly involved in coming up with solutions for problems that transcend disciplines, even
          before a single line of code was written.</p>

          responsibility was mainly with the front-end for the responsive website. I worked closely with the designer
          and the Sitecore/iOS developers because the main focus of the design was on the app and the website had to
          match that as closely as possible. Long-term project of several months in a SCRUM team. Some of the
          techniques
          used: <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>Webpack</strong>, <strong>Gulp</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>.
